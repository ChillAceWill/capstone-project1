The name of my site is LENA industrial we are a family industrial hardware store.

- I have a top navbar that I sourced from bootstrap using w3schools. I also changed the color of it by updating the class name.
- Included on the home page are two paragraphs as well as an unordered list. I added a class to the image and centered it using the margin-left property in my css.
  <Login>
- I have a login page for users to enter a username, password as well as use the remember me checkbox.
- The picture on this page was centered with a class that has a margin-left property value of 30% because of the image size.
- There are validations on the username and password making them required.
  <Registration>
- Includes a paragraph of tex.
- as with the login page there are validated form fields.
- a radio button is also featured.
  <Products>
- Included are three cards with a picture, a title as well as paragraph text, they are listed in a 3 column 2 row grid container class from bootstrap.
- The add to cart button also navigates to the checkout page.
- I changed the color of the add to cart button by updating the class name.
  <Checkout>
- Here you see a table with a header, text as well as a picture.
- The pictures were placed in a flexbox, which then allowed me to place them in columns.
- This page also features a shipping form with required validations.
